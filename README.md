Link to Description: 

Linear SVM has a better accuracy score than Gaussian Naive Bayes with 62.61% compared to 53.49%. The reason for this could be because Linear SVM is better suited for complex and non-linearly separable datasets. The SVM algorithm tries to find the maximum margin between the data points and the decision boundary, which makes it robust to outliers and non-linearities. Additionally, SVM allows for more flexibility in terms of choosing different kernel functions to tackle different types of data distributions. Gaussian Naive Bayes, on the other hand, assumes independence between the features and is not as robust as SVM for complex datasets.

The dataset size and structure, if the data has many features and is easy to interpret, Naive Bayes can be more effective.

The data distribution, Naive Bayes assumes that the features are independent, if the features in the data are not independent, the performance of Naive Bayes can decrease.

The accuracy of the model can also depend on the choice of hyperparameters, if the hyperparameters of the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm were not optimized, this could result in a lower accuracy score.
It is important to keep in mind that accuracy is not the only evaluation metric that should be considered, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score should also be considered to get a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
